	Once upon a time, there was an xteam of CS 400 students that were working away on their 3rd xTeam project. They were tasked with collaborating on various stories. Each member had their own story, and each member collaborated on everyone else's stories (a confusing sentence to read and an even more confusing process to do). One student, the one in charge of writing this paragraph, had a limited creative ability and resorted to giving a meta-narration about his experience writing the paragraph.
	However, as the students typed into the paragraph, creativity and inspiration seemed to diminish ever so slightly with every word. After too many minutes figuring out what to write into the file, the student writing this paragraph decided to commit their changes to the GitHub repository, so that the task could be completed at last.
