	Once upon a time, there was an xteam of CS 400 students that were working away on their 3rd xTeam project. They were tasked with collaborating on various stories. Each member had their own story, and each member collaborated on everyone else's stories (a confusing sentence to read and an even more confusing process to do). One student, the one in charge of writing this paragraph, had a limited creative ability and resorted to giving a meta-narraration about his experience writing the paragraph.
	The next student also was not creative and stuggled with starting a story for his other team member. He decided to use his own experiences to go off of when starting that story. For this story, he is just going along with what the previous team member was writing about, a very basic narrative of his own thoughts while writing this story.
	However, as the students typed into the paragraph, creativity and inspiration seemed to diminish ever so slightly with every word. After too many minutes figuring out what to write into the file, the student writing this paragraph decided to commit their changes to the GitHub repository, so that the task could be completed at last.
	The last student read through the story and found it hard to continue writing the story. She decided to add barely anything to the story and pushed it. The teaching assistant who was reading and grading the story felt so touched and sympathatic for the four students, because he struggled for writing a story in his undergraduate computer science course as well years ago. He decided to give all four students an A on this assignment.
