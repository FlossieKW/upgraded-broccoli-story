	Once upon a time, there was an xteam of CS 400 students that were working away on their 3rd xTeam project. They were tasked with collaborating on various stories. Each member had their own story, and each member collaborated on everyone else's stories (a confusing sentence to read and an even more confusing process to do). One student, the one in charge of writing this paragraph, had a limited creative ability and resorted to giving a meta-narraration about his experience writing the paragraph. The next student also was not creative and stuggled with starting a story for his other team member. He decided to use his own experiences to go off of when starting that story. For this story, he is just going along with what the previous team member was writing about, a very basic narrative of his own thoughts while writing this story.
